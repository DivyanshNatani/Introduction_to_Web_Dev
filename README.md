# Introduction to Web Dev

Check out these resources for respective topics.

So lets get started!!

If you have any doubt regarding to anything, feel free to contact me.

## [HTML, CSS, Bootstrap](https://github.com/DivyanshNatani/Introduction_to_Web_Dev/blob/main/html-css-bootstrap.md)

Other Resources: If you need more, you can check some of these [resourses](https://github.com/DivyanshNatani/Introduction_to_Web_Dev/blob/main/resource.md)

## [JavaScript](https://github.com/DivyanshNatani/Introduction_to_Web_Dev/blob/main/javascript.md)

Apart from above resources, I like this playlist to learn HTML + CSS + JS:
- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg

Itâ€™s a long playlist (~60 videos, 10-15min each) and I suggest that you can go to a specific video of what you want to learn. (Or you can go through all of them, if you can go x2 :p )

Small breakdown: (Speed x1.5 or x2 whatever suits you)

- Video 1-2: Basic Introduction and Installation of VS Code
- Video 3-12: HTML
- Video 13-20: CSS Basic
- Video 20-45: CSS Styling (Float, Flexbox, Grid, Media query. Can ignore long project video)
- Video 46-61: JS 
- Video 62 : JSON

Can ignore further videos of nodeJS and all for now.
