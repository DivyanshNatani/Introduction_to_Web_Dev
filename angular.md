## Angular
[Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs)
Angular documentation is one of the neatest in the market. You can go through the introduction part and tutorials can guide you with whole documentation.

I personally like this video for Angular Introduction because it has a very good project (to-do list, which involves quite many of main angular features.) I want you to build this same to-do list while following the video.

The video gets messy in between so if you don’t get any part at that time, just move on with the video and you will understand it in the end. If you don’t get it then as well, then ping me. I will help you with that.

Again, if you have doubt, just ping me, I'll help. Also, if you need a video tutorial, then we can organise that as well.
